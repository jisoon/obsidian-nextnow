Structured Logging
	1.	Enable Structured Logging: Use structured logging to output logs in a well-defined format, such as JSON. This approach makes logs easier to parse and analyze. Spring Boot 3.4 supports structured logging out of the box, allowing you to use formats like Elastic Common Schema (ECS) and Logstash.
	2.	Customize Log Format: You can create custom log formats by implementing the `StructuredLogFormatter` interface. This allows you to define how logs should be formatted, whether in JSON or another structure.
Logging Framework and Configuration
	1.	Use SLF4J with Logback: Spring Boot’s default logging setup uses SLF4J as a facade with Logback as the underlying framework. This setup is flexible, allowing you to switch to other frameworks like Log4j or JUL if needed.
	2.	Configure Logging Levels: Set appropriate logging levels for different packages or classes in your application using `application.properties` or `application.yml`. For example, you can set `logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG` to get detailed logs for web requests.
	3.	Use Logback Configuration: Define a `logback.xml` file to customize appenders, log levels, and output destinations. You can direct logs to different files based on their level using appenders like `ConsoleAppender` and `RollingFileAppender`.
Best Practices
	1.	Log Rotation: Implement log rotation to manage log file sizes and prevent disk space issues. Use Logback’s `RollingFileAppender` to rotate logs based on size or time interval.
	2.	Use Filters for Request Logging: Implement filters for logging specific requests or responses. Filters can be registered with the web container and are efficient for handling request-specific logging.
	3.	Audit and Error Logging: Use Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for cross-cutting concerns like audit logging or capturing exceptions across methods.
By following these practices, you can create a robust logging system that enhances your application’s maintainability and debugging capabilities while ensuring that logs are structured, comprehensive, and easy to manage.
